# TrojanUnityGame
 
A Trojan that can remotely view and delete the victim's data. The Trojan hidden under the Unity game was created for practice, for understanding TCP/IP servers, I do not advise doing any bad deeds with this Trojan, if only to make fun of a friend. The HiroNetwork TCP library is hidden because I don't want to distribute it.
